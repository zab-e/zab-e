# Hi, I'm Zabe! 👨‍💻🔐

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **self-taught ethical hacker** and cybersecurity enthusiast, currently 15 years old. My goal is to **improve the security of popular websites** and contribute to the open-source cybersecurity community. I’m passionate about **ethical hacking**, **penetration testing**, and **web application security**.

I believe in continuous learning and **sharing knowledge**. I'm actively working on improving my skills through **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges, **bug bounty** programs, and **vulnerability research**.

## 🧰 My Skills & Tools
- **Languages**: Python
- **Security Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Nmap, Wireshark
- **Web Security**: SQL Injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), and more
- **Frameworks**: Flask, Django (familiar with web security)
- **Operating Systems**: Kali Linux, Ubuntu, Windows
- **Bug Bounty Platforms**: HackerOne, Bugcrowd (beginner)

## 🚀 Current Projects
### 1. **Penetration Testing Automation**
I’m developing **Python scripts** to automate penetration testing for common web vulnerabilities like **SQL Injection** and **XSS**. These scripts are designed to help ethical hackers quickly assess the security of web applications.

### 2. **CTF Challenge Write-Ups**
I participate in **CTF challenges** to practice real-world hacking scenarios. I document my thought process and solutions, which helps me improve my skills and share with the community.

## 🤝 I’m Looking to Collaborate On
I’m always excited to work on projects that help improve web security and build better tools for penetration testers and ethical hackers. If you're working on any of the following, feel free to reach out:
- **Penetration Testing Tools**: I’m interested in contributing to or creating tools that help automate security testing.
- **Web Security Challenges**: Let's create and solve **ethical hacking challenges** together, especially beginner-friendly ones to help others learn.
- **Bug Bounty Research**: If you're looking for a partner to hunt for bugs, I’d love to collaborate on finding vulnerabilities in popular platforms.

## 🌱 I’m Currently Learning
- **Web Application Security**: Diving deeper into **web vulnerabilities** (SQLi, XSS, CSRF) and how to defend against them.
- **Advanced Python**: Working on mastering Python to write better automation scripts and security tools.
- **Bug Bounty Hunting**: I’m practicing on platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd to improve my skills in finding and reporting bugs.

## 🎯 My Goals
- **Improve security on popular websites** by identifying and reporting vulnerabilities.
- **Contribute to open-source security tools** and documentation.
- **Build my own security tools** for penetration testing and vulnerability analysis.
- **Expand my knowledge** in ethical hacking and cybersecurity best practices.
